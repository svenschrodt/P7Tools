# Data
Collection of classes working with simple (non-array or object) data structures:
     - Strings: ...
     - Integers: ...
     - Floats: ...
     
# Hint: since PHP 7 string, int etc. are reserved words, so the basic class names for those 
# data types are build with the suffix Class, like in \stdClass - e.g: StringClass
